  * The user should see an background image of the Yas marina formula 1 circuit.
  * The user should be able to click any of the cards which are facing down to flip it over and try to find the matching pairs.
  * The user should be able to find pairs by clicking on the cards. If the match, they stay flipped, if they don't match they will flip back.
  * The user should not be able to click on a new card until the two already flipped cards which are not matching and not flipped back.
  * The user should be receiving a message at completion of game.

### Structure 

* The game header will be vissible at all times, during and after game. The header is the name of the game (Formula 1 "rand prix racing" the Memory Game)

* Background image will be vissable at all times, during and after game.

* The start page will include a pop-up with explanation on how to play the game, and three buttons to choose difficulty level of game.

* Custom CSS will be used to make the game responsive by the use of media queries
* All pages will be responsive and the layouts will change dependent on screen size. This is to ensure content flow is appealing, images are displayed properly and that the content is not shrunk side by side, so small that it is unreadable. The purpose of this is to fulfill user story:

* All pages will contain a Footer section with time elapsed and amout of moves made by the user. The aim of the Footer elements is to fulfill user stories.

* HOW TO PLAY THIS GAME: you complete the game by matching the cards. You do that by clicking on the cards. If they match they stay flipped, if they don't match they will flipp back 
to the starting position.
